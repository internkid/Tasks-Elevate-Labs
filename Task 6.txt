Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength.

   Passwords                                          Strength

1. Priyansu123                                      Low(No special Character)
2. priyansu@123                                  Low(No uppercase character)
3. Priyansu@#                                     Low(No numbers)
4. PRIYANSU@123                               Low(No lowercase character)
5. 123456789                                        Low(Sequential password with no characters(Uc/Lc) or special characters)
6. Priyansu@123                                  Medium(Vulnerable to Dictionary attacks)
7. eUOu2ua44ZZgK0S                        Strong


Password Complexity affects security in many ways :
1. Increases Resistance to Brute-Force Attacks
Complex passwords with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols expand the total number of possible combinations, making it exponentially harder for attackers to guess through brute-force methods.

2. Reduces Vulnerability to Dictionary Attacks
Simple passwords often use common words or patterns that appear in hacking dictionaries. Complex passwords avoid predictable sequences, lowering the chance of being cracked quickly using pre-compiled wordlists.

3. Reduces the speed of Automated Cracking Tools
Password-cracking software works faster on short, simple passwords. A longer, more complex password increases processing time for each guess, buying crucial time before a breach can occur.

4. Protects Against Credential Stuffing
When reused passwords are leaked, attackers try them across multiple accounts. A complex, unique password for each service prevents easy cross-account compromise.

5. Balances Human Memory and Security
While complexity improves security, overly complicated passwords can lead users to write them down or reuse them, which introduces new risks. The best approach is a long passphrase thatâ€™s memorable yet unpredictable.
