Local Network Open Ports Scan – Quick Notes 
• Used Nmap (installed from official website) and optionally checked packets with 

Wireshark. 
• Found my local IP range using ipconfig. Range: 192.168.1.0/24. 
• Ran: nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24 
• Noted open ports: 

• Router (192.168.1.1): 80, 443 (web interfaces) 
• Desktop (192.168.1.10): 22 (SSH), 445 (SMB) 
• Old laptop (192.168.1.20): 3389 (RDP) 

• Wireshark used briefly to see scan packets—SYN packets visible. 
• Looked up port purposes: HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, SMB, RDP. 
• Potential risks: SMB and RDP ports can be dangerous if left open—plan to disable 

where not needed. 
• Saved scan results to a text file.
